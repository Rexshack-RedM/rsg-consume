## ✨ Features

### 🍴 Food, Drink & Stew
- Configurable consumable categories:
  - `Eat` → food items (e.g., bread, steak)
  - `Drink` → drinks (e.g., water, whiskey, coffee)
  - `Stew` → soups and stews (uses bowl animation)
- Each item can modify multiple needs:
  - Hunger, Thirst, Stress, Alcohol
- Items automatically become **usable** via `RSGCore.Functions.CreateUseableItem()`.

### 🍺 Alcohol System
- Each alcoholic item increases the player’s alcohol level.  
- At high levels, players experience:
  - Motion blur and camera shake
  - Drunken movement effects
- Alcohol level decays over time (`Config.AlcoholDecayRate`).

### 😌 Stress
- Certain foods/drinks can reduce stress.  

### 🎬 Immersive Animations
Each consumption type has its own prop and animation:
| Type | Animation | Example Prop |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Eat | “eat_food” | bread, meat |
| Drink | “drink_bottle” | bottle, mug |
| Stew | “eat_stew” | bowl |
| HotDrink | “drink_cup” | coffee cup |

Animations sync between client and nearby players for full immersion.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.lua`)

Example structure:
```lua
Consumables = {
    Eat = {
        bread = {
            hunger = 30,
            thirst = 0,
            stress = -5,
            alcohol = 0,
            propname = "p_bread01x",
        },
    },
    Drink = {
        water = {
            hunger = 0,
            thirst = 35,
            stress = -2,
            alcohol = 0,
            propname = "p_bottle02x",
        },
        whiskey = {
            hunger = 0,
            thirst = 10,
            stress = -10,
            alcohol = 25,
            propname = "p_bottleWhiskey01x",
        },
    },
    Stew = {
        stew = {
            hunger = 50,
            thirst = 10,
            stress = -10,
            propname = "p_bowl04x",
        },
    },
}
```

### 🔧 Key Configuration Fields
| Key | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hunger` | How much hunger to restore |
| `thirst` | How much thirst to restore |
| `stress` | Stress modifier (negative reduces stress) |
| `alcohol` | Adds alcohol level (higher = stronger drunk effect) |
| `propname` | Object used in animation (prop model name) |

### 🧮 System Settings (from config)
```lua
Config.AlcoholDecayRate = 0.2  -- How quickly alcohol wears off
Config.AnimDuration = 5000     -- Default consumption animation duration (ms)
Config.Debug = false           -- Enable debug prints
```
